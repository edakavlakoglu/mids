    "The purpose of this analysis is to assess the market opportunity to grow ridership for Lyft Bay Wheels through offers and promotions via their mobile app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon analysis of the available data, some quality issues have been identified, such as:\n",
    "* mislabeling of time zone as UTC instead of PST \n",
    "* method of data collection for zip code data is subject to errors (e.g. 'nil'); may be better to collect this data based off of credit card information\n",
    "* Subscriber_type information could be more granular. It's not clear how often subscriber users are churning, which can impact the effectiveness of a promotion strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, based on the available data, we are able to determine that ridership behavior is seasonal, where ridership tends to increase during summer months. This may be due to increased tourism and/or an increased desire to enjoy warmer weather by residents of San Francisco. Complementary survey data may help to supplement why seasonal trends occur, particularly among subscribers. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also key locations that are frequented by \"commuters.\" We have defined commuters as any trips that start or end at a train station using the bike station name fields, start_station_name and end_station_name. We've defined train station bike stations as any bike station name containing the words: \"caltrain\", \"rail\", or \"bart\". These are the top stations, which occur within the top 5 most popular trips among commuters: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. SF Caltrain 2 (330 Townsend) \n",
    "2. Townsend at 7th \n",
    "3. Embarcadero at Folsom \n",
    "4. SF Caltrain (Townsend at 4th)\n",
    "5. Harry Bridges Plaza\n",
    "6. Steuart at Market\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these observations, we recommend the following options to be considered as part of the promotional strategy:\n",
    "* To boost ridership in December, it may be helpful to run a promotion as a holiday special (e.g. give the gift of ridership). \n",
    "* A promotion could also be offered in January to capitalize off of new years resolutions (e.g. weight loss, outdoor goals, et cetera). This type of offer may help to convert customers to subscribers. It may also help to stabilize ridership in January. \n",
    "* Summer promotions could highlight the impact of bike ridership on the city's carbon footprint, which may persuade residents and tourists to choose bikes vs. ubers/lyfts. \n",
    "* Given the high traffic of riders at Harry Bridges Plaza, Lyft may want to host a ridership recruitment event nearby. The event could primarily focus on converting customers to subscribers by highlighting the benefits of bike ridership that current subscribers have already experienced. \n",
    "* It might also make sense to offer a promotion to nearby companies to companies in the surrounding areas of the 5 most popular commuter trips. Corporate memberships can be helpful in converting new users and the mobile app could potentially be used to gamify ridership through a point system. Similar to the days of company kickball or softball, employees can potentially compete with neighboring companies for the most miles ridden. "

    "Subscribers make up the lion's share of ridership, making up about 80-95% of riders each month with a few exceptions in August and September 2013. That said, low subscribers at the onset makes sense if the ridership program was in its infancy. Both subscribers and customers frequent similar destinations with Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry Building) and Embarcadero at Sansome reaching the top 5 for as starting stations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the bike trip behavior by month and year, there is seasonality in the bike trip behavior. Both customers and subscribers tend to ride less in the winter months. That said, ridership was higher for subscribers in January 2015. Additional context as to why would be helpful in providing recommendations to increase ridership. For example, was it an unusually warm January that year or was there an ad campaign running that promoted more bike usage? \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, commuters, as we've defined it above, make up about 41% of bike ridership, and the share of commuters riding bikes has not changed significantly over time after the first couple of months. Like subscribers and customer segments, commuters also tend to frequent Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry Building). The top stations among the 5 most popular commuter trips are: \n",
    "* SF Caltrain 2 (330 Townsend) \n",

    "* Embarcadero at Folsom \n",
    "* SF Caltrain (Townsend at 4th)\n",
    "* Harry Bridges Plaza\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:** \n",
    "* To boost ridership in December, it may be helpful to run a promotion as a holiday special (e.g. give the gift of ridership). \n",
    "* A promotion could also be offered in January to capitalize off of new years resolutions (e.g. weight loss, outdoor goals, et cetera). This type of offer may help to convert customers to subscribers. It may also help to stabilize ridership in January. \n",
    "* Summer promotions could highlight the impact of bike ridership on the city's carbon footprint, which may persuade residents and tourists to choose bikes vs. ubers/lyfts. \n",
    "* Given the high traffic of riders at Harry Bridges Plaza, Lyft may want to host a ridership recruitment event nearby. The event could primarily focus on converting customers to subscribers by highlighting the benefits of bike ridership that current subscribers have already experienced. \n",
    "* It might also make sense to offer a promotion to nearby companies to companies in the surrounding areas of the 5 most popular commuter trips. Corporate memberships can be helpful in converting new users and the mobile app could potentially be used to gamify ridership through a point system. Similar to the days of company kickball or softball, employees can potentially compete with neighboring companies for the most miles ridden, fostering company pride and culture."
