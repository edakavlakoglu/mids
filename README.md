# Projects and Assignments from UCBerkeley's Information and Data Science Master's Program

Welcome! My name is Eda Kavlakoglu, and this is my data science portfolio from my graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley. The work in this repo are from the following classes that I've taken thus far: 

# W200: Introduction to Data Science Programming

This fast-paced course gives students fundamental Python knowledge necessary for advanced work in data science. Students gain frequent practice writing code, building to advanced skills focused on data science applications. We introduce a range of Python objects and control structures, then build on these with classes on object-oriented programming. A major programming project reinforces these concepts, giving students insight into how a large piece of software is built and experience managing a full-cycle development project. The last section covers two popular Python packages for data analysis, NumPy and pandas, and includes an exploratory data analysis.

# W203: Statistics in Data Science 

The goal of this course is to provide students with an introduction to many different types of quantitative research methods and statistical techniques for analyzing data. We begin with a focus on measurement, inferential statistics and causal inference using the open-source statistics language, R. Topics in quantitative techniques include: descriptive and inferential statistics, sampling, experimental design, tests of difference, ordinary least squares regression, general linear models.

# W205: Fundamentals of Data Engineering

Data Science depends on data, and a core competency mandated by this reliance on data is knowing effective and efficient ways to manage, search and compute over that data. This course is focused on how data can be stored, managed and retrieved as needed for use in analysis or operations. The goal of this course is provide students with both theoretical knowledge and practical experience leading to mastery of data management, storage and retrieval with very large-scale data sets.

# W207: Applied Machine Learning 

Machine learning is a rapidly growing field at the intersection of computer science and statistics concerned with finding patterns in data. It is responsible for tremendous advances in technology, from personalized product recommendations to speech recognition in cell phones. This course provides a broad introduction to the key ideas in machine learning. The emphasis will be on intuition and practical examples rather than theoretical results, though some experience with probability, statistics, and linear algebra will be important.
